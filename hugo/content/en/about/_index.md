I'm Denis Malolepszy, active in the IT industry since 2010. Based in Frankfurt am Main.

In 2022, I started my own business as a software architect and took over the chairmanship of the supervisory board of [DenktMit]({{< relref "/denktmit" >}}), a cooperative that I co-founded in 2021.

## Software Development
Today, I am focusing on the [development of custom software and cloud infrastructure in the Java environment]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}).

As a freelancer, I am open to both short consulting assignments and long-term projects.

In case I should be unavailable, or if the technology is not my area of expertise, I am happy to pass inquiries on to [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}) and find an available expert for you.
