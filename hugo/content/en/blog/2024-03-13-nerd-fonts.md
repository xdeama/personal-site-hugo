Nerd Fonts patches developer-targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs (symbols). Specifically, to add a large number of additional glyphs from popular “iconic fonts” such as Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, and others.

These fonts make IDEs and terminals on Mac, Linux, and Windows more readable, visually appealing, or just nerdier. Having nearly 10,000 integrated icons in one font means, for example, that you can save yourself from having to use a separate Material or FontAwesome font set. And that you can get icons without any effort in places that only allow one font set.

On [NerdFonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and in the [GitHub Project Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), you can find information on installation and what is included in the fonts.

The project maintainers are awesome and have published each one in package managers like brew, etc.
```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install <nerd-font-name>
```
