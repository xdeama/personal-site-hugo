## Hello, I'm Denis

I am a freelance *Software Architect*, *Full Stack Developer*, and co-founder of [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), a
network of independent IT specialists. Currently, I live and work in Frankfurt am Main.

{{< static-img src="denis.png" class="profile-img frame" alt="Denis" >}}

I design and develop sophisticated [custom software and cloud infrastructure]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) for the
finance and energy sector that stands the test of time with maintainability, resilience, and traceability.

In this process, I accompany custom software from the *Java ecosystem* through its entire lifecycle: from requirements
analysis, IT architecture, concept design, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and extension.

Need support for your project? Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmalolepszy)
{{< linkedin-icon >}}&nbsp;or contact me directly via [Email](mailto:kontakt@dmalo.de).


## Project Experience

After a decade in the financial industry, I moved into the world of transmission system operators in 2024 and, as a
Software Engineer, I modernize systems for maintaining grid stability with cloud-native applications.

In 2022 and 2023, as a DevOps Engineer using Java, Spring Microservices, Angular, Ansible, and OpenShift, I supported
the private cloud migration of a large international bank.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as Head of IT, IT Architect, Team and Project Leader, Scrum Master,
Software Developer, DevOps Engineer, and in charge of IT operations for custom and standard software.

Before becoming self-employed, I was:

- Head of IT at Habona Invest, an asset manager from Frankfurt am Main,
- Application Manager in reporting at Union Investment,
- and Software Engineer in the financial industry for Cofinpro AG.

From the project's start, I contributed to building an agile project team as a service provider, and beyond my role as a Software Engineer, I also:

- Guided requirements analysis,
- Designed the solution architecture,
- And supported the UI/UX design.

As the project team grew, I handed over the respective areas of responsibility to dedicated project members and focused on front-end and back-end development.

## Product Data Management in Vehicle Development

### **August 2010 - March 2012 (with breaks, see [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}))** | Working Student

However, since product data represents a graph rather than a tree structure, this approach had significant difficulties
with data duplication.

I developed a concept and a prototype, tested it with a vehicle development team, and dedicated my bachelor's thesis to
the topic.
