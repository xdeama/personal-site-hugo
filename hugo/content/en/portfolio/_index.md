## Hello, I'm Denis

I am a freelance *Software Architect*, *Full Stack Developer*, and co-founder of [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), a
network of independent IT specialists. Currently, I live and work in Frankfurt am Main.

{{< static-img src="denis.png" class="profile-img frame" alt="Denis" >}}

I develop durable and extensible [custom-tailored]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) business software based on open-source
technologies.

Modern architectures, robust domain models, and a special focus on fault tolerance and logging form the basis for
durability. I achieve long-term extensibility through high regression test coverage.

These approaches make technologies replaceable and systems renewable, avoiding the need for complete redevelopment,
which might otherwise be necessary after a decade at most.

I design and develop sophisticated [custom software and cloud infrastructure]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) for the
finance and energy sector that stands the test of time with resilience, maintainability, and extendability.

In this process, I accompany custom software from the *Java ecosystem* through its entire lifecycle: from requirements
analysis, IT architecture, concept design, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and extension.

## Project Experience

After a decade in the financial industry, I moved into the world of transmission system operators in 2024 and, as a
Software Engineer, I modernize systems for maintaining grid stability with cloud-native applications.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as Head of IT, IT Architect, Team and Project Leader, Scrum Master,
Software Developer, DevOps Engineer, and in charge of IT operations for custom and standard software.

Before becoming self-employed, I was:

- Head of IT at Habona Invest, an asset manager from Frankfurt am Main,
- Application Manager in reporting at Union Investment,
- and Software Engineer in the financial industry for Cofinpro AG.
