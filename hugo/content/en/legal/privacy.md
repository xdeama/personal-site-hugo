I place a high value on privacy, therefore this site uses:
- no cookies
- no tracking tools
- no external resources such as fonts
- no Content Delivery Network

The web server does not store IP addresses long-term.

The server logs save the following information:
- Visited website URL
- Date and time of your visit
- Amount of data transferred
- Source/Origin (how you found this site)
- Your web browser and operating system
- Your IP address

The server logs are automatically deleted after 14 days.
