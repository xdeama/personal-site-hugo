## Custom Software for a Transmission System Operator
### **May 2024 — May 2025** | Software Engineer
*Denis Malolepszy Software Engineering, Frankfurt am Main*

Design and development of custom software for outage planning at a transmission system operator.

Manual data transfers and media breaks are replaced with a new cloud-native system using open-source technologies.
This involves replacing multiple legacy applications, modernizing a dozen data interfaces, and providing role-optimized overviews and workflows.

From the project's start, I contributed to building an agile project team as a service provider, and beyond my role as a Software Engineer, I also:

- Guided requirements analysis,
- Designed the solution architecture,
- And supported the UI/UX design.

As the project team grew, I handed over the respective areas of responsibility to dedicated project members and focused on front-end and back-end development.

## Data Integration Software for a Transmission System Operator
### **May 2024 — January 2025** | Software Engineer
*Denis Malolepszy Software Engineering, Frankfurt am Main*

An automated adapter between a legacy software and a publication platform of the association of transmission system
operators minimizes manual work steps in the context of publication.
For this, I:

- Developed cloud-native data integration software based on Spring Boot,
- Integrated with the legacy system using Kafka,
- Transformed multiple XML documents into a standardized format,
- Which is transmitted to an association platform for publication,
- And broken down in an Angular web app for tracking,
- Or passes error messages to collaboration systems via webhook.

## Product Data Management in Vehicle Development
### **August 2010 - March 2012 (with breaks, see [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}))** | Working Student
*EDAG GmbH & Co. KGaA, Fulda, Germany*

As a working student, I initiated a project to enable product data management in vehicle development in the in-house inventory software jEDWIN. Product data was managed in spreadsheet programs and exchanged with customers and suppliers. However, since product data represents a graph rather than a tree structure, this approach had significant difficulties with data duplication.

I developed a concept and a prototype, tested it with a vehicle development team, and dedicated my bachelor's thesis to the topic.
