# Hi,

I'm Denis. Freelance software architect, full stack developer and co-founder of [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), an
expert network of self-employed IT specialists.

{{< static-img src="denis.png" class="profile-img frame hidden-on-desktop" alt="Denis" >}}

I design and implement [custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) for the finance and energy sector that stands the
test of time through resilience, maintainability, and extendability.

If you’ve got a project in mind, get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmalolepszy)

## Software Development

At its core, the development of customized software is usually about automating work processes.
However, I find all those use cases particularly interesting in which response times, data volumes or reliability could
not be achieved by any number of employees working manually.

While the individual business needs are always in the foreground, I focus on 
[developing systems]({{< ref "projects" >}}) that can be operated efficiently and further developed in the long term.

I guide [custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) throughout its entire lifecycle: from requirement analysis, IT
architecture, design, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and extension.

## Project Portfolio

After a decade in the financial industry, I moved into the world of transmission system operators in 2024 and, as a
Software Engineer, I modernize systems for maintaining grid stability with cloud-native applications.

In 2022 and 2023, as a DevOps Engineer using Java, Spring Microservices, Angular, Ansible, and OpenShift, I supported
the private cloud migration of a large international bank.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as a Head of IT, IT Architect, Team and Project Leader, Scrum Master,
Software Developer, DevOps Engineer, and as responsible for the IT operations of custom and standard software.

I've worked on in recent years.
