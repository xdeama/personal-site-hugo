# Hi, I'm Denis

I am a freelance software architect, full stack developer and co-founder of [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), an expert network of self-employed IT specialists.

{{< to-img src="denis.jpeg" class="profile-img frame" alt="Denis" >}}

I develop [sophisticated custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) for the finance industry that stands the test of time through maintainability, resilience, and observability.

If you’ve got a project in mind, get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmalolepszy)

## Software Development
I assist my clients in the financial sector to solve complex problems through automation. My primary focus is to meet business needs and [develop systems]({{< ref "/projects" >}}) that can be operated and evolved efficiently and effectively in the long term.

I guide [custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) throughout its entire lifecycle: from requirement analysis, IT architecture, design, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and support.

## Project Portfolio
In 2022 and 2023, I supported the private cloud migration of a large international bank as a DevOps Engineer using Azure DevOps, Java, Spring, Angular, Ansible, OpenShift, and Helm.

Previously, I assisted a Swiss software manufacturer with an archiving system for migration to a new intranet system based on a web crawler. Kotlin and Selenium were used for the web crawler, while the archiving system was enhanced with Apache Solr for a powerful search function.

My [Project Portfolio]({{< ref "/projects" >}}) and [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}) provide an overview of the projects I've worked on in recent years.

## DenktMit
[DenktMit](https://denktmit.de) is a versatile network of seasoned IT professionals. Partners - more than just advisors.

Our [members](https://denktmit.de/team/) share knowledge, experiences, and assist in project placements. We jointly invest in entrepreneurial infrastructures – from employing software developers for project support to shared cloud infrastructure and tax consulting.

At DenktMit, we collectively build what would be too risky, costly, or unaffordable alone, while each of us maintains our entrepreneurial independence.
