# Hi,

I'm Denis. Freelance software architect, full stack developer and co-founder of [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), an expert network of self-employed IT specialists.

{{< static-img src="denis.png" class="profile-img frame hidden-on-desktop" alt="Denis" >}}

I design and implement [custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) for the finance industry that stands the test of time through maintainability, resilience, and observability.

## Software Development
At its core, the development of customized software is usually about automating work processes.
However, I find all those use cases particularly interesting in which response times, data volumes or reliability could not be achieved by any number of employees working manually.

While the individual business needs are always in the foreground, I focus on [developing systems]({{< ref "projects" >}}) that can be operated efficiently and further developed in the long term.

I guide [custom software]({{< ref "/consulting" >}}) throughout its entire lifecycle: from requirement analysis, IT architecture, design, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and support.

## Project Portfolio
In 2022 and 2023, I supported the private cloud migration of a large international bank as a DevOps Engineer using Azure DevOps, Java, Spring, Angular, Ansible, OpenShift, and Helm.

Previously, I assisted a Swiss software manufacturer with an archiving system based on Kotlin for migration to a new intranet system based on a web crawler.
