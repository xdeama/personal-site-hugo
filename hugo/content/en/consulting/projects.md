## Investment Advice Analytics System and Dashboard
### **December 2016 — July 2017** | Lead Developer

Halfway through the project, I took over the leadership of a five-member development team in an agile project organization, assuming the role of *Scrum Master* and further developing the architecture.

## Product Data Management in Vehicle Development
### **August 2010 - March 2012 (with breaks, see [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}))** | Working Student
*EDAG GmbH & Co. KGaA, Fulda, Germany*

As a working student, I initiated a project to enable product data management in vehicle development in the in-house inventory software jEDWIN. Product data was managed in spreadsheet programs and exchanged with customers and suppliers. However, since product data represents a graph rather than a tree structure, this approach had significant difficulties with data duplication.

I developed a concept and a prototype, tested it with a vehicle development team, and dedicated my bachelor's thesis to the topic.
