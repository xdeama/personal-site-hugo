My project portfolio includes projects from my time as a freelancer, as well as permanent positions, as I believe the nature of the contract plays a secondary role in the experiences gained.

## Personal Website with Custom Hugo Theme
### **October 2023 — October 2023** | Self-Directed
This website may not win any design awards. However, it was created in Hugo with a custom CSS theme, offering an opportunity to delve deeply into CSS. I learned a lot during this process, thanks to [Every Layout](https://every-layout.com).
Additionally, I implemented a language switch link and dark mode without cookies. More details will follow in [blog posts]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
The source code is published in a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xdeama/personal-site-hugo).

## Modernizing CI/CD for Private Cloud Migration
### **March 2022 — September 2023** | Freelance as a DevOps Engineer

I supported a major international bank in their private cloud migration, modernized deployment pipelines, and migrated them to Azure DevOps.

A central CI/CD portal uses Angular, Spring Gateway, and Keycloak to provide software developers and project managers with access to deployment tools for containers, virtual machines, and databases.

The chosen microservices architecture with Spring, REST, and Kafka allows dedicated teams for different infrastructure types to independently develop their tools with minimal coordination, while users can access all infrastructure types through a common portal.

## Web Crawler-Based Archiving System
### **December 2022 — January 2023** | Freelance as a Software Engineer

Together with my [team from DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), I developed a web crawler-based archiving system for a Swiss software manufacturer to migrate an intranet system. A web crawler extracts web content through full rendering including JavaScript and archives the results. An Apache Solr instance provides a search index. A React web app serves as an entry and search portal, while a Go web server reproduces the archive as a website. The system automatically creates archives of the client's intranet.

## Investment Advice Analytics System and Dashboard
### **December 2016 — July 2017** | Lead Developer at Cofinpro AG

The Investment Tax Reform Act presents asset managers with the challenge of having details of dividend distributions of all components of their funds several months in advance in order to comply with the law.

For this purpose, numerous data sources were merged, analyzed daily, and a dashboard was provided to asset management, facilitating the legally compliant planning of transactions.
Halfway through the project, I took over the leadership of a five-member development team in an agile project organization, assuming the role of *Scrum Master* and further developing the architecture.

## Modernization of a Joomla Website

Administration of Microsoft workstations, mail, and file servers for the Ulenspiegel bookstore in Fulda and Ravensburg. An in-house implemented data backup on a batch basis with retention logic and error handling sounds scary, but it saved significant licensing costs back then.

## Product Data Management in Vehicle Development
### **August 2010 - March 2012 (with breaks, see [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}))** | Working Student at EDAG GmbH & Co. KGaA

As a working student, I initiated a project to enable product data management in vehicle development in the in-house inventory software jEDWIN. Product data was managed in spreadsheet programs and exchanged with customers and suppliers. However, since product data represents a graph rather than a tree structure, this approach had significant difficulties with data duplication.

I developed a concept and a prototype, tested it with a vehicle development team, and dedicated my bachelor's thesis to the topic.

### Technologies
- Java SE
- Swing
- Progress OpenEdge
- Linux
