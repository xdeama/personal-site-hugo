As a Software Architect and Full Stack Developer, I enable my clients in the financial and energy sectors to solve complex
problems through automation.

I develop individually tailored business software that can be operated and expanded in the long term. This is based on
robust domain models, unit and integration tests, as well as a focus on fault tolerance and logging.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as Head of IT, IT Architect, Scrum Master, Software Developer, and DevOps
Engineer.

I support custom software throughout its entire lifecycle: from requirements analysis, architecture, conception,
implementation, test automation, CI/CD, rollout to maintenance and servicing.

## Tech Stack

I bring more than seven years of full-time Java experience from various projects. Details on my technical expertise can
be found in my [project portfolio]({{< ref "projects" >}}). I am very open to learning and applying new technologies and
methods.

My focus in recent years has been on the *Spring Framework*, *relational databases*, and cloud architectures based on
*Kubernetes* and *TypeScript*-based front-end technologies like *Angular*.

## Freelancer, Not a One-Man Show

Together with [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), a network of independent IT experts, I put substance back into the
overused buzzword "digitalization." We put our clients back in the driver's seat of their digitalization strategy.
