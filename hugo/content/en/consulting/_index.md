As a Software Architect and Full Stack Developer, I help my clients in the financial sector solve complex problems through automation.

The primary focus here is on meeting business needs and building systems that can be operated and developed efficiently over the long term.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as Head of IT, IT Architect, Scrum Master, Software Developer, and DevOps Engineer.

I accompany individual software through the entire life cycle: from requirements analysis, IT architecture, design, implementation and rollout to maintenance and servicing.

My [project portfolio]({{< ref "/projects" >}}) and my [CV]({{< ref "/about/cv" >}}) provide an overview of the projects I have worked on in recent years.

## Freelancer but not a One-Man-Show
In collaboration with [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), a network of independent IT experts, I restore real substance to the overused buzzword "digitalization" and put you back in the driver's seat of your digitalization strategy.



## Tech Stack
I focus on the Java ecosystem, especially Spring Framework, relational databases, and private cloud architectures based on Kubernetes.

This includes a wide range of products and open source software, frameworks and libraries such as Camunda, Kafka, Solr, Angular, Swagger, Kibana and others.

My previous experiences regarding technologies are listed in the [project portfolio]({{< ref "/projects" >}}). I am very open to learning new technologies for projects.
