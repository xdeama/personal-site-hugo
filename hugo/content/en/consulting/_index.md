As a Software Architect and Full Stack Developer, I help my clients in the financial sector solve complex problems through automation.

I accompany your custom software through its entire lifecycle: from requirements analysis, IT architecture, conception, implementation, and rollout to maintenance and care.

Together with [DenktMit]({{< ref "/denktmit" >}}), a network of independent IT experts, I restore real substance to the overused buzzword "digitalization" and put you back in the driver's seat of your digitalization strategy.

Over the past decade, I have gained experience as Head of IT, IT Architect, Scrum Master, Software Developer, and DevOps Engineer.

Technically, I focus on the Java ecosystem, especially the Spring Framework, relational databases, and private cloud architectures based on Kubernetes. You can find out about my previous experience with technologies in the [project portfolio]({{< ref "/projects" >}}). I am very open to learning new technologies for projects."
